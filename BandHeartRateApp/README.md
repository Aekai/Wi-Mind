Application for Android OS (Android 4.4.4 in our case) for collecting and saving the heart rate data to a file from a Microsoft Band 2. Application does not handle any errors, as it is used as a simple application and no future work for this app was meant to be made. 

Note that the code is taken from the available Microsoft Band SDK and includes only simple code adaptations from the examples/templates.
