The goal of this project was to infer with humans cognitive load. Its preliminary results were presented in UbitTention workshop article and a more detailed description of overall system was presented in master thesis at University of Ljubljana.

The project contains:
* wireless monitoring module (GNU Radio's *gr-radar* module) 
* feature extraction module (to filter and extract human breathing and heartrate features), along with neural network evaluation approach
* machine learning (Orange's workflows)
* band heart rate app (application for Android to acquire heart rate from Microsoft Band 2)
* and folder *study data*, which consists of the raw data from wireless module and from the cognitive load measuring app (not included in this project)
